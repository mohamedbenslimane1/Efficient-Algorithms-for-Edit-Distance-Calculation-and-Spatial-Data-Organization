The project involves implementing and analyzing two algorithms for calculating edit distances between strings: a dynamic programming approach and a naive recursive approach. 
The dynamic method uses a matrix to store results of subproblems, making it efficient for longer strings. The naive approach, while simpler and direct, recalculates all subproblems and is less efficient for 
longer strings. The text also outlines a method to assess the time complexity of these algorithms by generating random strings of varying lengths and measuring the computation times.
Additionally, the exercise includes implementing a k-d tree for organizing points in multi-dimensional space, demonstrating its utility in efficient spatial searches compared to naive methods,
particularly highlighted through its application to the CIFAR-10 dataset for nearest neighbor searches.
